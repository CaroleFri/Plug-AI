# Plug-IA

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a ubiquitous tool in medical imaging. However, it requires advanced programming skills, access to computing resources as well as the sequence of several steps to pre-process the images upstream and analyze the results downstream of the AI. In this context, Plug-AI aims to develop an unparalleled framework, deployed on the Jean Zay calculator and open to the French scientific community, which makes it possible to eliminate programming complexity and provide a robust AI experiment manager. relying on the computing power provided by Jean Zay. More specifically, we propose a framework that centralizes the loading of images, their pre-processing, then the choice and configuration of an AI architecture to provide a set of statistics as output. From a practical point of view, we propose to focus on a segmentation task around multi-organ data from public databases and completely de-identified on the basis of known architectures to reproduce the results of the associated challenges. to these databases. The framework will be generic, allowing the user either to start training an existing model on a database that he will provide, or to test a new model on existing databases.
