# Plug-AI: A Deep Learning Tool for Medical Applications

## Introducing Plug-AI:
Plug-AI is a tool developed with the goal of easing the application of deep learning techniques within the medical field. To achieve this, Plug-AI offers two distinct functionalities that cater to different user needs.

### Deep Learning Pipeline Application
The first functionality is an application that allows users to define a deep learning pipeline using a configuration file. This file enables users to choose and customize various components, such as data sources, models, optimizers, loss functions, hyperparameters, and learning rate schedulers. The aim is to simplify the process of setting up a deep learning pipeline, allowing users to focus on their specific goals.

### Code Library for Development
The second functionality of Plug-AI is a library that provides a set of functions designed to support the development of new deep learning approaches. By offering reusable code blocks, this library aims to save time and effort for developers who are working on novel solutions in the medical domain.

### Conclusion
In summary, Plug-AI strives to be a helpful tool in the application of deep learning technologies within the medical field, offering both a pipeline application and a code library to cater to various user requirements.
